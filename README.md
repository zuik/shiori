## Stack
- mongoDB
- Python 3.6
    - flask
    - pymongo

## Development log
- 20 Jan 18
    - Project started.
    - For now, we would make do with a simple API that just handle adding and listing links.
    - For now, we would hard code pymongo address in the config file. But I really want to find a solution that allows more flexibility than this for bigger projects.
